# Diabetes
Hi everyone
I designed a small interface that calculates whether the person is diabetic or not, with a 75 percent success rate, based on values such as pregnancy, insulin value, body mass index etc. 
All you have to do is enter the requested information and press the 'Check' button.

You can learn the result with the 'Check' button and 'Reset' all data with the reset button.
